Battles of Virtue

Three champions stand
To face a test of courage.
There will be no winner.

War has no victors,
But those lucky enough
To never quarrel.

Errol

The crack of a rifle echoed throughout the camp. In the centre of camp was the Imperial command tent. The congression of officers and guardsmen held a low murmur as the commander went over the maps laid out on the table. The room fell silent as Lord Dryden stepped inside the command tent. His personal bodyguard trailed behind him, her hand firmly placed on her sword. Her name was not said by the soldiers. Only her title was spoken, and in hushed whispers across the camp; the ”Praesia”. She broke the silence, as she drew her sword and swung it down beside her hip. All in the room - the commanding officers, the guards - drew a fist across their chests and stood at attention. Dryden stepped forward, taking up a place at the war table. “Commander, inform me of current affairs.”

The commander relaxed slightly. “My Lordship, the Federation has garrisoned troops at a small border town. We have come to several possible courses of actions, and are finalizing the decision.”

A man spoke up in the crowd, stepping forward to reveal himself. He shook slightly, nervous. “Lord Dryden, would it not be better to navigate around the town? The Federation soldiers are not as threatening as they seemed to be.”

Dryden looked at the soldier. There was anger in the Lord’s eyes, but it disappeared in a moment. The Praesia had noticed, though, and seized the guardsmen by the throat, bringing him down to his knees before he could say a word. Dryden held up his hand. “Azami, please. Don’t spill Imperial blood here.”

She said nothing, pushing the man’s head into the dirt. The guard coughed into his forearm. “Thank you, My Lord.”

“What is your name?” Dryden asked, looking down at the man.

“Fresco. Errol Fresco, My Lord.” He tapped the patch on his uniform. 

Dryden turned to the commander and nodded. “Have him executed at dawn. By firing squad.”

Azami gripped the collar of his uniform and began to drag him away before Errol even processed the lord’s words. He screamed and yelled as she pulled him from Dryden’s sight. The soldiers stopped what they were doing and stared at the disturbance. It was not a rare sight to see someone condemned by the Imperial leaders on a whim. Some laughed at Errol, others gave silent nods of pity.

Errol fought the Praesia’s grip. Flailing for something to grip on the ground, on himself, on the Praesia’s person. He gripped the handle of her sword and pulled firmly. She dropped him as she fumbled for her own weapon. Errol was on his feet in a moment, using his full person to push her away from the blade. They both tumbled into the dirt.

Snickers and gasps sounded from the building crowd, as Errol crawled his way over to the sword first and stood up with the blade in hand. Azami Praesia made her way to her feet, naturally standing up straight; prideful and arrogant.

Errol emulated Azami’s dueling stance. Two hands on the grip and legs evenly spaced apart, he faced his opponent without proper confidence. His opponent adopted the combat stance of a martial artist and the air was as tense as it had ever been at the military camp. Azami moved first and Errol trailed behind. She stepped around a blind jab forward and flung her back leg up towards his face. It swung inches away from his nose, and he made his move with the blade.

Azami’s feet made contact with the ground and she turned around to face Errol. He spun around wildly to find his opponent. She looked at him, her hand dropping out of her stance to feel the blood dripping from her chest. She fell to her knees, her face contorted in pain.

“Bastard,” she swore. “Errol Fresco, your death will be the object of my obsession. Run, for I prefer my prey to be scared.”

Errol gripped the blade tightly in his hands and pointed it towards Azami. “Damn the Imperium! We’ve tried to fight for order, but all we’ve been given is suffering! I’m tired of fighting!”  He tossed the blade to the ground. “Tell Dryden that you failed him.”

Something in Azami’s eyes changed as she processed his words. “Failed him?” she choked. Her form slouched and her ego deflated.  Errol turned and ran, pushing past the gathered crowd and into the refuge of the Federation forests.

“Sir Ryker, the scouts have reported that the Imperials have become restless. I anticipate the attack will be soon.” 

Ryker took a drink from his cup of tea and smoothed his moustache out with a gloved hand. “Thank you, Catherine. Add a sniper to the church tower and let the scouts rest. I will be out shortly to revise the defenses.”

Catherine brought her hand up to her brow and saluted. “I shall prepare for your arrival.” She turned to leave but stopped herself. “Ryker, we… found an Imperial soldier near the town outskirts.”

“If you have received all the information you can, let them go. The Imperials already know where we are.”

“We didn’t interrogate him. He came in, told us everything he knew, and now he wants to join us.”

Ryker set his cup down. “This is quite a bit more important than something you add on at the end.” 

“I didn’t know if I should bring it up. We’re all on edge here, and the Imperium is on our doorstep.” She crossed her arms, and shook her head slowly. “If you have to worry about an Imperial inside, then you’re not focused about the Imperials outside.”

Ryker held his hand up. “Catherine, an Imperial inside can tell us about the Imperials outside. Now, tell me what else you haven’t shared with me.”

“Your brother.”

“What about my brother?”

“David Dryden’s leading the invasion.”

Ryker laughed, prompting Catherine to make a confused look. “You believed that would surprise me? I’ve already made my decision on the matter, Catherine. When we come to blows, I will not relent simply because we share the same mother.”

“We kill David?” Catherine asked.

“If the Lord Dryden gives us the chance.”



The warmachines of the Imperium were fearsome. Wars had been won because of the might of the Imperium’s armoured vehicles, and most feared the approach of Imperial steel. Errol only feared the response of his new allies when the armoured beasts finally made their move. The Federation soldiers had anti-armour weaponry and the training to use it, but the rush of combat could result in anything.

When the first armoured destroyer finally broke through the treeline, he was relieved to see the Federation detachment move into action immediately. He watched from the church tower as anti-tank mines turned pieces of mastercraft into gnarled metal scrap. It was a sad but satisfying sight.

Errol spotted Lord Dryden’s personal battle tank in the distance. Its cannon turned, almost looking towards him. He stared back, picking up his scoped rifle and peering out over the sea of explosions. The church shook as a wayward shell landed at the base of the tower. He ran as soon as he processed the information, skipping multiple steps at once before hitting the bottom of the stairs. Sergeant Catherine greeted him. He joined up with her squad and pushed forward towards the edge of town.

The tanks had begun to subside, the mighty tanks of the Imperium now smoldering wrecks that dotted the field around the town. It was quiet for a moment, before the sound of a cheer and a charge of Imperial foot soldiers came into the field.

Errol helped the soldiers around him fire upon the approaching mass of Imperials, but they swarmed over the rifle-carrying soldiers and a massive brawl broke out. Catherine looked to Errol and shook her head. She grabbed the rifle from Errol’s hands, pushed him over and ran. He couldn’t tell if it was a betrayal, or a condemnation.

Errol stood, and watched as the fight continued around him. Out of the chaos came the flowing cloak of Azami Praesia. Errol drew his pistol, as the Praesia cut down the soldiers who stepped in her path; Federation or Imperial. She looked at Errol and quickened her pace. Errol lifted his pistol and fired, but each shot seemed to catch in someone else who stepped in the way. He began to back away, but she was much too close already. His luck had only ran so far.

The Praesia’s blade slipped effortlessly through him, and then glided out of him as she stepped past him. She had killed him with such little regard. Errol felt blood reach up into his mouth, and he began to gag as his feet lost their strength. He toppled to the ground. Errol tried to shake his head at his own stupidity.

He had not been the hero of this story.

Azami

“The Federation anticipates an attack will be soon; we must use this to our advantage.”

Azami followed beside Dryden as they made their way to the command tent. “Of course, my Lord. Your wisdom is beyond my understanding.”

“Ryker Loyal leads the deployment meant to slow our advance, but he will only accomplish that. If my plan is received well by the officers, then I want you to carry out a message.”

Azami Praesia nodded. “My sword belongs to you alone.”

“Find Ryker and his second in command, and kill them both.”

“I shall leave when you are ensured to be in safe hands. Sir Ryker and the Lasiin girl will fall by my hand tonight.”

Dryden said nothing more as he entered the command tent. Azami followed closely behind. There was silence, as the lord had not been expected to arrive on such short notice. As his right hand, she was to demand respect towards her superior.

She gripped the handle of her blade and drew it beside herself. Fear flashed in the eyes of all as they saluted her. Dryden stepped forward and began his talk with the Imperial officers. She noticed one of the guardsmen as he lifted a cup in a shaky hand. Azami eyed him and stepped towards him. He froze and looked up. “Lady Praesia, my apologies.”

She looked at the patch on his breast pocket. “Private Fresco. I would request that you calm yourself. There is much stress within the fabrics of this tent, and it would be best if you did not contribute to it.”

Errol nodded and set the porcelain cup down. “Of course, my Lady.”

Azami turned back to the proceedings and as the commander began to show Dryden specific details on the map, she left quietly.

The forest’s branches filtered the light of the sun so that it fell only on her brow. It was warm, much warmer than the palaces in the Imperium. The fireplaces gave a type of warmth, but she could feel how artificial it was. Smiles were given in her direction out of fear, rather than respect or kindness. If it was the will of her lord, then she would endure it for as long as he wished.

She began to stride carelessly through the forest, the weight of the rifle on her back and the knife in her boot the only reminder that this was not her home. Once she reached the edge of the greenery, she stopped and hid behind the trees.

There was the occasional sound of laughter, cry of anguish, crack of a rifle. Her enemies were lively, but she knew that would only be temporary. 

Ryker Loyal. She paused to take an angered breath. Lord Dryden spoke of him often; an obsession that threatened to destroy Dryden. For each rant about Ryker’s betrayals, Azami found herself following her lord’s example. Sir Ryker had to die, for Dryden’s vision of the future could not come to fruition without death. The vision was the only thing that gave her life purpose.

The church bell rang, and she used the fleeting distraction to move quickly through the open field and into the town itself. Her pace slowed once she heard the cobblestones under her feet. She judged the town hall to be the most immediate location to search. The Federation soldiers that lounged about the front gave her reason to pause, and then to simply observe. The windows of the building offered her little information, until the sergeant herself appeared in a second story window. Catherine looked out across the square and turned away to disappear.

That was all Azami needed. She waited for the guard to hold their gaze in a single direction, then she moved. The door offered very little resistance when she ripped the door handle out with her knife. A gasp of breath sounded from the stairs as a soldier looked down at her from the fifth step from the bottom, and he turned to run. Azami tightened the grip on her knife, pulled it behind her head and threw it.

A hollow crack echoed throughout the hall as the guardsman’s head connected with the top step. Azami wrenched the knife from between the man’s shoulder blades and bounded up the stairs in search of her targets.

“... The scouts have reported that the Imperial’s have become restless. I anticipate the attack will be soon.” 

Azami pressed herself up against a door. No, wrong room. She shifted to the next one, and peered in between the crack of the door. This time it was correct. “Thank you, Catherine. Add a sniper to the church tower and let the scouts rest. I will be out shortly to revise the defenses.”

Azami pulled her rifle from her back and allowed herself a breath. She had known the adrenaline of the moment to be intoxicating before, but the feeling had begun to dull. Perhaps she would be sick after this; it had happened before.

She set her boot against the door and kicked. They all looked towards her, just like in the Imperial palace, just like on the battlegrounds. She looked to Catherine, pulled back her knife and hurled it forward. Catherine moved, and lodged itself in the chest of the soldier behind her. Azami brought her rifle up, only for it to be pushed to the side by one of the men beside the door. The weapon left her hand, and she reached out to pull the pin from the grenade on his chest, and gave the appropriate measure of force to kick him out of the window.

Azami looked up to face Ryker’s second in command. Catherine ripped the knife from her dead comrade and pointed the slick blade towards Azami. “You bitch! If Dryden wanted to kill us he should have came himself, not send his whore!”

Azami slipped to the side, avoiding her opponents lunge. She slipped her leg under Catherine, and brought her to the ground in a smooth motion. A gunshot echoed throughout the room and Azami looked to Ryker, who held a calm look on his face as the pistol registered empty clicks. “It would appear that I have missed,” Ryker mumbled.

Azami took Catherine’s pistol from her hip and lowered it down towards Catherine’s head. She fired, blood splattering against her uniform. She turned to Ryker, and pressed her finger against the trigger. Ryker dropped his pistol and lifted his hands above his head. “It’s over then,” he said, trying his best to maintain eye contact with Azami, trying to not look to Catherine’s corpse. “End it!”  he yelled. “Pull the trigger!”

Azami closed the gap, ramming her forearm into Ryker’s chest and pressing the pistol against his forehead. She attempted to unnerve him with her gaze, but Ryker refused to bend to her will. It made her grow frustrated. “You are the cause of my Lord’s grievances. Repent so that I might make your death painless.”

Ryker had his own gaze, one of fearlessness. “Dryden deserves everything that happens to him. If I die, someone else will take my place.” He proceeded to spit in her face.

Azami slowly lifted the pistol from Ryker’s brow and wiped the spit from her face. “So be it, Ryker.”

She whipped him across the face with the weapon and let it fall from her hands. He recoiled, and Azami pushed his head against the wall and grasped his throat with both hands. Ryker struggled against her grasp, but she was not satisfied yet. She threw Ryker to the side, stooped down to pick up a fallen Federation soldier’s combat knife and returned to her victim.

The man attempted to crawl away, but she caught up to him and spun him onto his back. Azami jammed the knife into his ribs, before wrenching it out and plunging the blade back. To cause the one man who eluded her such pain was all she could do to appease Dryden. She continued until her victim became silent.

She had murdered four people in the span of three minutes. Her mission was complete, her lord’s enemies were dead, and her usefulness had been diminished. Azami looked at her blood soaked hands as a clamour of voices sounded from outside the room. Capture was unacceptable.

The Praesia retrieved Sergeant Catherine’s pistol from the floor and undid the safety. She closed her eyes and set the weapon against the side of her head. “All glory to you, Lord Dryden.”

This was not her story.

Catherine

The sharp crack of Imperial rifles marked the official beginning of the Imperial military camp’s day. In the treeline sat members of Catherine’s scouting group, as well as the sergeant herself.

“Corporal, give me a sitrep,” she asked one of her men with binoculars.

“One of the Imperial lords just entered the command tent, followed behind by his bodyguard.”

“Specific identities?”

“I can’t say, Sergeant.”

Catherine took the binoculars and laid herself down on the ground. She put her focus on the command tent, then circled around the area. She made mental notes of high concentrations of soldiers, gun emplacements, and armouries, before circling back to the command tent.

A soldier left the folds of the tent and proceeded down the camp towards the forest area. Catherine turned back towards her company. “I want a scout on that soldier. Disarm him, tie him, and bring him to me.”

Someone ran and Catherine turned back to the camp. Dryden was there, she knew it.

Catherine counted the time for her scout to return. One minute and thirty eight seconds later, the sounds of plant life being pushed to the side and a struggling Imperial soldier reached her ear. The scout pushed the soldier towards Catherine’s boots as she stood to look.

“Name and rank,” she asked.

The man looked up at her, his eyes composed mostly of anger. “Errol Fresco. Second platoon, private first class.”

His resistance only made Catherine smile. “Well, Errol, who holds the highest rank at your camp?”

Errol tilted his head to the side. “The commander- wait.” He shook his head. “Lord Dryden arrived but a few minutes ago.”

“Good.” Catherine nodded, and turned to one of her scouts. “We’ll take him back to town.”

Errol interrupted sharply. “Wait, how did you get here? Did you take a direct path, or did you go around the forest?”

Catherine looked down at him. “Why?”

He bit his lower lip and looked to the trees. “It’s not like the Imperium doesn’t watch this forest. It always watches its flanks."

Catherine whispered to the scout beside her. "Take two others and do a sweep." The scout departed immediately.

"A sweep isn't enough. There are probably eyes on you already," Errol said cautiously.

"My squad knows its training." The foliage rustled and Catherine looked up. "Don't tell me someone got lost." One of the scouts tumbled out of the bushes and landed on their face. A glint of metal flashed in the scout's back. 

"Tighten formation!" Catherine shouted. "Weapons forward!"

Another scout stumbled out of the foliage, his hands tied behind his back. "They found us.” The man looked dejected. “I'm sorry, Sergeant."

A man in Imperial colours appeared behind them, and set a knife against the throat of Catherine's scout. "Lord Dryden wants you alive." He looked to Errol. "He’ll also want him."

Catherine flipped the safety on her pistol. "We only stand down if you ensure my soldiers will not be harmed further."

The Imperial bowed his head down. "I will speak to his Lordship personally."



"Sergeant Catherine Lasiin. How lovely that you would grace me by your presence."

"I just had to see your leadership in action, Dryden. I'll be sure to tell Ryker all about the trip when I leave."

Dryden lifted his glass of brandy in one hand. "You were always the more sarcastic one."

Azami stood behind Dryden's desk. "Her arrival saves me the trouble of finding her later."

Catherine crossed her arms. "Of course, Azami. I felt so bad after I shot your teacher in the face that I just had to come by." Azami shook her head and returned to her usual silence.

"Now, Catherine," Dryden began, "I would like to present a proposal-"

"Return us to Ryker and we let you take the town? The answer is very simple. No."

Dryden set his glass down. "I actually wanted to drink that." He gestured Azami forward.

Two guards pushed Catherine back into her chair, holding her arms on the table. Azami pulled a knife from her boot and laid her hand on Catherine's wrist. Dryden leaned forward. "Now, could you repeat your answer?"

Catherine struggled against the grip of the Imperials on her arms. "Dryden, you bastard! Do what you want with me!" Azami pushed the knife against Catherine's smallest finger, digging the blade into her flesh.  

Catherine bit her lip and tried to hold in her anguish. "Dryden, you- fuck!" She felt the digit separate from her hand and buried her face into her shoulder as best she could. Dryden watched her intently, while the grips of the guards loosening. 

With teary eyes, Catherine urged him on. “I’ve been through worse. Bring it on, Dryden.” Dryden motioned to Azami and she took up the knife again.

Catherine ripped herself from the grip on her right arm and stole the knife from Azami. She shoved the blade into the throat of the guard on her left and pushed herself up off the chair. Catherine pushed Azami away and hurtled herself over the desk. Her hand landed on Dryden’s glass and she lifted it up, smashing it against his skull.

Azami moved to restrain her, drawing the knife from the corpse of the guard. Catherine avoided the slash, and moved under Azami, flipping the other woman over her back. Catherine gripped the blade itself and wrenched it from Azami's grasp, slamming the grip into the woman’s face and pushing herself free.

Dryden slowly stood up from his position on the ground. He glared, his demeanor changed to rage. "You dare attack me-!" He choked back his words as Catherine dug the blade into his abdomen.

"It's over," Catherine said as she let go of the knife and let Dryden fall to the floor. Catherine turned to Azami. "It's over! He's dead!" She used her uninjured hand to grab a handful of her hair, losing herself in the aftermath of the chaos.

Azami only looked surprised. "It's over."
